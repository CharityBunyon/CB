        <p class="about-para">Welcome!<p>

        <p class="about-para">My name is Charity Bunyon. I started coding in 2018 when one of my students introduced CSS and JavaScript to me. It was that moment that I fell in love with programming and knew I wanted to be a developer.<p>

        <p class="about-para">My current strength is building out front-end applications. I enjoy using React, APIs, and Sass to create robust and aesthetically pleasing applications. Also, I love API development, wireframing, and working with SQL to build databases. Iâ€™m working toward obtaining a full-stack position because I want to make sure I become a well-rounded developer, obtaining and strengthening my skills in order to be an asset to my team members.<p>

        <p class="about-para">Furthermore, I would consider myself a lifelong learner. New technologies and skills are always available. This excites me because I know that it will always be something or someone I can learn from and grow.<p>
